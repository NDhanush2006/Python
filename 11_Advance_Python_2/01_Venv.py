# VIRTUAL ENVIRIONMENT :-->

An environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other
Python environments on the system.

# INSTALLATION -->
To use virtual environments, we write:-
pip install virtualenv # Install the package

# We create a new environment using: -
virtualenv myprojectenv # Creates a new venv
The next step after creating the virtual environment is to activate it.
We can now use this virtual environment as a separate Python installation.

# Steps To Make Virtual Environment:---->
1.Type in Terminal:-      pip install virtualenv
            |
            |
            -
2. After install of package type again :- Virtualenv virtual_environment_name - you want to create 
Eg :- virtualenv myproject

3.After creating virtual environment it will be install folder with your virtual_environment_name package
"""
# 4.To activate Virtual Environment:-
#.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1

'''
PIP FREEZE COMMAND :-

pip freeze returns all the package installed in a given python environment along with
the versions.

pip freeze > requirements .txt

The above command creates a file named requirements.txt in the same directory
containing the output of pip freeze.
We can distribute this file to other users, and they can recreate the same environment
using:
'''
# pip install â€“r requirements.txt

# By running the  above Command we can install the paxkages that we installed in txt
